## Description

This project was created as one of the three projects from the Engeto Academy - Front-end Developer course. The goal of this project is to imitate as faithfully as possible the visual design of a page titled "Your Travel Assistant." The main benefit of implementing this project is to practice media queries, which are used to adjust various cascading styles of the page based on the size of the device on which they are displayed, especially mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and large monitors.
